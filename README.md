# FooBar

This repository contains a solution to the FooBar problem.

## Problem Description

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with the following conditions:

- For numbers divisible by 6, print "Bar".
- For numbers divisible by both 4 and 6, print "FooBar".
- Otherwise, print the number itself.

## Solution

The program is implemented in Python and solves the problem by iterating through numbers from 1 to 100 and checking the divisibility conditions for each number.
